<strong>Technical Designer (Unity/C#) | VFS Game Design 2026 | B.F.A. in Digital Contents (Kyung Hee) | Shipped projects + systems</strong>

I design systems that are playable, testable, and shippable. My strongest work sits between design and implementation: I turn big ideas into rules, tuning tables, and level flows that engineers and artists can actually build. I love discovering the why behind player behavior and then shaping the flow through mechanics, pacing, and feedback.
